# Task 1.2P Interrupts

My interrupt is based on code from <a href="https://makersportal.com/blog/2019/5/27/arduino-interrupts-with-pir-motion-detector">here</a>.

Interrupts are attached in each loop, which executes the Sense-Think-Act from Task 1.1, before going into a power saving mode using a low power Arduino library.

The code is triggered using a PIR sensor, with a demonstration of my working project viewable at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZQiN-Z7cO0">this</a> Youtube link.
